Hotel and Resort Customer Assistant is a mobile and web application designed for an organization that handles room accommodation and food ordering. This system has three users: administrator, chef and guest which have their own privileges. In the mobile application, the features are creating order of meals/room services and booking of rooms used by the guest. Meantime, in the web application, the administrator manages the request of the guest and the chef views and approves meals that are pre-approved by the administrator. The modules of this system are ordering of meals, booking of rooms created by the guest, and managing the requests by the administrator. The developers conducted a survey to twenty-one (21) respondents (guests) and two (2) administrators to know about the improvements of the system. The results of this survey showed positive feedbacks from the respondents with 81% extremely likely and 19% very likely to recommend and use this automated system. Implementing this system will bring efficiency than the manual operation of a hotel and resort.
